      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
        We first came up with this project while solving LeetCode problems together. 
        During our sessions, we realized there wasn’t a reliable platform that allowed 
        seamless real-time collaboration—apart from VS Code Live Share. 
        However, even that tool often proved unreliable and lacked several key features 
        we wished for. This inspired us to create our own solution - WeCode.
